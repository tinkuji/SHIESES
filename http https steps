HTTP HTTPS STEPS

HTTP and HTTPS difference
HTTP is a type where the entered details in the form displays the contents in the URL of the website (thus, makes it vulnerable for attacks)
HTTPS is a secure connection where the entered details is encrypted and showed in the URL

-vulnweb.com
-get the ip for this (url to ip website- https://www.site24x7.com/find-ip-address-of-web-site.html)
-enter the ip in the filter for wireshark
- write command: ip.addr==________ (the ip address for the website)
-apply filter
-open the login page on the vulnweb website
-enter login credentials
-switch to wireshark
-search for an HTTP packet line which has POST method in the info section
-on the down left hand side, look for "HTML form url encoded" and expand it
-there you can see the uname and password that you entered

HTTPS cannot be implemented as wireshark is not capable of capturing packets for a secure connection on the HTTPS website
